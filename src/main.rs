/*!
*One Way Out* (OWO) is a multiplayer telnet game. The game
*state is in a [Game] struct that is initialized at game
*start and managed by a [GameHandle] wrapper. The
*[GameHandle] implements the play loop in its [play()]
*function.

At startup, a new [GameHandle] is created. Then the
connection listener is started. As players connect, they are
placed into the game and given a dedicated client proxy.

OWO is a "turn-based" game, with the provision that the
world updates when *any* player acts. This "time only moves
when *someone* moves" model is a bit unusual. During the
turn, the game simulation steps forward a step, regardless
of the amount of elapsed time since the last turn.
